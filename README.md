# svelte-language-server-web

Svelte language server within a web worker.

Based on/inspired by: https://github.com/asafamr/monaco-svelte/

## Improvements

- Uses latest packages for TS, Svelte, svelte-preprocess, etc.
- Editor-agnostic, use with Monaco, VSCode Web, CodeMirror...
- Works (almost) fully like you'd expect!
